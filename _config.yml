description: Hey there, I am Ripunjay Singh, currently pursuing an MS in Cybersecurity at New York University Tandon School of Engineering. I am currently working as an AI/ML Engineer Intern at LTIMindtree, and I am also exploring software supply chain risks in a Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) in conjunction with DTCC. I have soaked up a lot through my experience in various roles. I geek out over tools like Splunk and Tableau, love diving into Firewalls and SIEM tech, and thrive on tackling everything from vulnerability puzzles to cloud security challenges. Always up for the next big cybersecurity adventure, I am all about learning and pushing the boundaries in this ever-evolving field.
